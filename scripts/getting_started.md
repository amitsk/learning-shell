## 1. What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting lets you automate tasks by writing a series of shell commands in a file (a script). These scripts can:

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Process files and data
- Manage system operations

---

## 2. Setting Up Your Environment

### Linux

- Most distributions come with Bash pre-installed.
- Open your terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T or search for "Terminal").

### macOS

- The default shell is Zsh (as of macOS Catalina), but Bash is also available.
- Open Terminal (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal").

### Windows

- **Recommended:** Use [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) for a modern terminal experience.
- **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux):**
  - Install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run a real Linux environment on Windows.
  - You can use Ubuntu or other distributions from the Microsoft Store.
  - Access your Linux files and run Bash scripts just like on a real Linux machine.
- **Git Bash:** A lightweight Bash environment included with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## 3. Writing Your First Script

1. Open your terminal.
2. Create a new file:

   ```sh
   nano hello.sh
   ```

3. Add the following lines:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, world!"
   ```

4. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).
5. Make it executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x hello.sh
   ```

6. Run your script:

   ```sh
   ./hello.sh
   ```

## 4. Recommended Tools

- [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/): A fast, customizable, and minimal prompt for any shell. Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (including WSL2 and PowerShell).
- [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal): Modern, tabbed terminal for Windows. Supports PowerShell, Command Prompt, WSL, and more.
- [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing scripts.

## 5. Notes on the `scratch` Directory

- Any files you create in the `scratch` directory are ignored by Git and will not show up as changes. Use this directory for experiments and temporary files.
