# Shell Customization Guide

This guide covers how to customize your shell environment, including configuration files and prompt customization.

## 0. Your Home Directory & Shell Basics

### What is the Home Directory?

- Your home directory is your personal space for files and configuration on Unix-like systems.
- The path is usually `/home/username` (Linux) or `/Users/username` (macOS).
- Shortcut: `~` always refers to your home directory.
- To go to your home directory:

  ```sh
  cd ~
  # or simply
  cd
  ```

### Who Am I? (Finding Your Username)

- Use the `whoami` command to print your current username:

  ```sh
  whoami
  ```

### Identifying Your Current Shell

- To see which shell you are currently using:

  ```sh
  echo $SHELL
  # or
  ps -p $$
  ```

## 1. Shell Configuration Files

### Bash

- `~/.bashrc`: Runs for interactive non-login shells. Place aliases, functions, and prompt customizations here.
- `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`: Runs for login shells. Use for environment variables and commands that should run once per session.
- `~/.bash_logout`: Commands to run on shell exit.

### Zsh

- `~/.zshrc`: Main config for interactive shells. Place aliases, functions, and prompt customizations here.
- `~/.zprofile`: Runs for login shells.
- `~/.zlogout`: Commands to run on shell exit.

---

## 2. Common Customizations

### Aliases

Add shortcuts for common commands in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
alias ll='ls -lFh'
alias gs='git status'
```

### Functions

Define your own shell functions:

```sh
mkcd() {
  mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}
```

### Environment Variables

Set variables for your session:

```sh
export EDITOR=vim
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### Vi Mode

Enable vi-style command line editing in your shell:

```sh
set -o vi
```

- This allows you to use vi keybindings for editing commands
- Press `Esc` to enter command mode, then use vi commands like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for navigation
- Use `i` to return to insert mode
- Add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to make it permanent

---

## 3. Prompt Customization

### Bash Prompt (PS1)

Customize your prompt by setting the `PS1` variable in `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
export PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
```

- `\u` = username
- `\h` = hostname
- `\w` = current directory

**Example with colors:**

```sh
export PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\]:\[\e[34m\]\w\[\e[0m\]$ "
```

### Zsh Prompt

Zsh uses the `PROMPT` variable:

```sh
export PROMPT="%n@%m:%~$ "
```

## 4. Advanced Prompt: starship.rs

[starship.rs](https://starship.rs/) is a fast, customizable, and minimal prompt for any shell.

- Install with:

  ```sh
  curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
  ```

- Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

  ```sh
  eval "$(starship init bash)"
  # or for zsh:
  eval "$(starship init zsh)"
  ```

- Configure with `~/.config/starship.toml`

---

## 5. Reloading Your Config

After editing your rc/profile files, reload them with:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```
